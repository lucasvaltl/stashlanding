#Stash Landing Page
Stash is a potentially disruptive startup conceptualised in the MSIN7008 Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice class taken at UCL. The page can be accessed (here)[https://lucasvaltl.github.io/stashlanding/].

The page is based on a template from (startbootstrap.com)[https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/new-age/]. It was modified extensivly using CSS, HTML and Javascript in order to appear in line with the brand that was envisioned for stash.
